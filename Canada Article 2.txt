Canada's economy is highly developed and one of the largest in the world. In 2020, the 
country's annual gross domestic product (GDP) was $1.64 trillion in current USD, according 
to the latest available World Bank data. That made Canada the world's ninth-largest economy.1

Canada's economy is highly dependent on international trade with exports and imports of goods 
and services each comprising about one-third of GDP.2 The country's three largest trading 
partners are the U.S., China, and the U.K. Its three largest industries, measured by their 
contributions to GDP, are real estate, rental, and leasing; manufacturing; and mining, quarrying, 
and oil and gas extraction.3


Canada is home to the e-commerce company Shopify Inc. (SHOP.TO, SHOP), major banks such as 
the Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO, RY), and energy transportation and distribution company 
Enbridge Inc. (ENB.TO, ENB).


The COVID-19 pandemic caused Canada's economy to pull back sharply in the first half of 2020 
before rebounding in the latter half of the year. In the second quarter of 2020, real GDP fell 
11.3% quarter-over-quarter (Q/Q), but rose 9.1% Q/Q in the third quarter and then 2.2% Q/Q in 
the fourth quarter of 2020, offsetting the steep decline earlier in the year.4


Real GDP was up 0.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. The 
increase in first-quarter GDP was fueled in part by low mortgage rates, rising housing demand, 
and government transfers to households and businesses.4
