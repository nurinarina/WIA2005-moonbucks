China Economic Outlook
June 21, 2022

The economy lost significant steam in early Q2 on widespread Covid-19 lockdowns: In April, 
retail sales and industrial production recorded their sharpest annual contractions since 
early 2020. The economy regained some momentum in May, as the impact of the pandemic ebbed, 
with retail sales, industrial production, fixed investment and export figures all beating 
expectations. However, overall activity remained downbeat, with the housing market particularly 
depressed. Towards the end of Q2, the marked fall in total Covid-19 cases and the recent 
easing of lockdowns in many areas—including Shanghai—will aid household spending, exports 
and industrial activity. On the other hand, the threat of further stop-start restrictions 
will continue to weigh on sentiment, with Beijing and Shanghai resuming mass testing in 
mid-June in response to the emergence of new Covid-19 clusters.
China Economic Growth
Growth will slow sharply this year due to the government’s tough pandemic measures, the 
steep property downturn and cooling export growth. That said, stronger infrastructure 
stimulus should provide some support. Downside risks include persistent Covid-19 restrictions 
and a deepening of the property crisis, while the possibility of a rollback of U.S. tariffs 
is an upside risk. FocusEconomics panelists expect GDP to expand 4.4% in 2022, which is down 
0.3 percentage points from last month’s forecast. In 2023, the panel foresees GDP expanding 
5.2%.

China Economy Overview
Economic Overview

The Chinese economy experienced astonishing growth in the last few decades that catapulted 
the country to become the world's second largest economy. In 1978—when China started the 
program of economic reforms—the country ranked ninth in nominal gross domestic product (GDP) 
with USD 214 billion; 35 years later it jumped up to second place with a nominal GDP of USD 
9.2 trillion.

Since the introduction of the economic reforms in 1978, China has become the world’s 
manufacturing hub, where the secondary sector (comprising industry and construction) 
represented the largest share of GDP. However, in recent years, China’s modernization 
propelled the tertiary sector and, in 2013, it became the largest category of GDP with a 
share of 46.1%, while the secondary sector still accounted for a sizeable 45.0% of the 
country’s total output. Meanwhile, the primary sector’s weight in GDP has shrunk dramatically 
since the country opened to the world.

China weathered the global economic crisis better than most other countries. In November 
2008, the State Council unveiled a CNY 4.0 trillion (USD 585 billion) stimulus package in 
an attempt to shield the country from the worst effects of the financial crisis. The 
massive stimulus program fueled economic growth mostly through massive investment projects, 
which triggered concerns that the country could have been building up asset bubbles, 
overinvestment and excess capacity in some industries. Given the solid fiscal position of 
the government, the stimulus measures did not derail China’s public finances. The global 
downturn and the subsequent slowdown in demand did, however, severely affect the external 
sector and the current account surplus has continuously diminished since the financial 
crisis.

China exited the financial crisis in good shape, with GDP growing above 9%, low inflation 
and a sound fiscal position. However, the policies implemented during the crisis to foster 
economic growth exacerbated the country’s macroeconomic imbalances. Particularly, the 
stimulus program bolstered investment, while households’ consumption remained relatively 
low. In order to tackle these imbalances, the new administration of President Xi Jinping 
and Premier Li Keqiang, beginning in 2012, have unveiled economic measures aimed at promoting 
a more balanced economic model at the expense of the once-sacred rapid economic growth.

Economic History

After Mao Zedong’s death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping—who was the core of the second generation 
of Chinese leadership—became China’s paramount leader and pushed ahead bold reforms that 
reshaped the country’s economy. At the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China, held in December 1978, Deng announced the official launch of the 
Four Modernizations—agriculture, defense, industry and science and technology—which marked 
the beginning of the reform and opening-up policies. Economic reforms under Deng’s era 
increased the role of market mechanisms and reduced government control over the economy. 
The measures included, among others, breaking down the collective farms, opening up China 
to foreign investment, encouraging business entrepreneurship, establishing Special Economic 
Zones and introducing market incentives in the state-owned companies. Moreover, China 
started to participate in the global economy and the country joined the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in 1980.

In early 1990s, Jiang Zemin—the third generation of Chinese leadership—became the new paramount 
leader of the country and his administration implemented substantial economic reforms. Under 
his mandate, most of the state-owned companies, except large monopolies, were privatized or 
liquidated, thus expanding the role of the private sector in the economy at the cost of leaving 
millions unemployed. During the same period, President Jiang and Premier Zhu Rongji reduced 
trade barriers; ended state planning; introduced competition, deregulation and new taxes; 
reformed and bailed out the banking system; and drove the military stratum out of the economy. 
In addition, Jiang guided China to join the World Trade Organization in December 2001, 
which buttressed the country’s trade.

In 2002, Jiang Zemin stepped down as General Secretary of the Communist Party, thereby 
initialing the transition to the fourth generation of leadership, led by President Hu Jintao 
and Premier Wen Jiabao. The Hu-Wen administration tried to reduce the income gap between the 
coastal cities and the countryside, as China’s skyrocketing growth mostly benefited just one 
part of the population. They increased subsidies, scrapped agricultural taxes, slowed 
privatization of state assets and promoted social welfare. Despite the government’s efforts 
to prevent the country from overheating, by the mid-2000s the economy experienced an 
unprecedented economic growth mainly due to booming exports, resilient private consumption, 
soaring manufacturing and massive investment. However, the 2008 global financial crisis 
forced the Chinese authorities to launch an aggressive stimulus package and adopt a loose 
monetary policy.

The fifth generation came to power in 2012, when President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang 
took the reins of the country. The new Xi-Li administration unveiled an ambitious reform 
agenda in an attempt to change the country’s economic fundamentals and ensure a sustainable 
growth model. In this regard, authorities expressed their willingness to tolerate lower growth 
rates as a necessary condition to push forward economic reforms. Xi coined the term “Chinese Dream” 
as his contribution to the guiding ideology of the Communist Party of China. Although vague, 
the “Chinese dream" emphasizes people’s happiness and the idea of a strong China.

The Chinese dream has endured some growing pains. Although still solid, economic growth has 
slowed. In 2015, the Chinese economy missed its 7.0% growth target for the year by 0.1 percentage 
points, marking the first time in two decades that growth has come in below target. Investment 
in manufacturing and infrastructure is slowing as the nation shifts from an investment driven 
growth model to one more focused on consumer demand.

China’s Balance of payments

China’s external position is extremely solid. The current account has recorded a surplus in 
every year since 1994. The capital account followed suit and only recorded two deficits in 
the last 20 years. This situation of surpluses in the both the current and the capital put 
pressure on the national currency and prompted the Central Bank to sterilize most of the 
foreign currency that entered the country. As a result, China’s foreign exchange reserves 
skyrocketed to almost USD 4.0 trillion in 2014. The current account surplus reached its peak 
in 2007, when it represented 10.1% of GDP. Since then, however, the surplus has since narrowed 
as the currency strengthened and domestic demand increased.

China’s capital account has bold controls, which implies that the country lacks the freedom 
to convert local financial assets into foreign financial assets at a market-determined exchange 
rate and vice versa. The new Xi-Li administration and the People’s Bank of China vowed to 
accelerate interest rate liberalization and capital account convertibility. In this regard, 
Chinese authorities have started to implement some measures, such as removing a cap on 
foreign-currency deposit rates in Shanghai and releasing some controls on the currency.

The capital account benefited from strong inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). FDI 
has performed strongly in the last decade, with record inflows of USD 118 billion in 2013, 
thereby becoming the second largest recipient of foreign investment. Among the countries 
that invest more in China are Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. 
In addition, China’s outward investment soared in recent years and, according to some analysts, 
the country could become a net exporter of capital in the coming years.

China’s Trade Structure

China has experienced uninterrupted trade surpluses since 1993. Total trade multiplied 
by nearly 100 to USD 4.2 trillion in only three decades and, in 2013, China surpassed 
the United States as the world’s biggest trading nation.

The opening of the country and the government’s massive investment programs have prompted 
the country to become a major manufacturing hub. This situation fostered trade growth, particularly 
after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. As an economy highly integrated 
into the global trade system, the country benefited from a steady improvement in its terms 
of trade since 2000. However, the global economic downturn in 2008-2009 led the country to 
reduce manufacturing output, thus dragging on China’s trading sector.

Moreover, the country has engaged in several bilateral and multilateral trade agreements 
that have opened new markets for its products. In 2003, China signed the Closer Economic Partnership 
Arrangement with Hong Kong and Macau. A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between China and the ASEAN 
nations came into effect on January 2010, which created the world’s third largest free trade area 
in terms of nominal GDP. China also established, among others, FTA with countries such as, 
Australia, Chile, Costa Rica, Korea, Pakistan, Peru, New Zealand, and Singapore. Moreover, 
there are other FTAs under negotiation with the Gulf Cooperation Council, Japan, Norway and 
Sri Lanka.

Exports from China

Electronics and machinery make up around 55% of total exports, garments account for 13% and 
construction material and equipment represent 7%. Sales to Asia represent over 40% of total 
shipments, while North America and Europe have an export share of 24% and 23%, respectively. 
Although exports to Africa and South America expanded rapidly, they only account for 8% of 
total shipments.

Due to favorable global trade conditions and China’s accession to the World Trade Organization 
in December 2001, the country has experienced an astonishing growth of 26.9% annually in real 
goods and services exports during the 2002-2008 period. Imports to China

In order to supply factories and support China’s rapid development, the country’s imports are 
mostly dominated by intermediate goods and a wide range of commodities, including oil, iron ore, 
copper and cereals. China’s soaring demand for raw materials pushed global commodity prices up 
leading up to 2015, thereby boosting the coffers of many developing nations and commodity-exporting 
economies. However, since the end of the commodities super cycle at the end of 2014, global 
commodities prices have fallen partially due to a decrease in demand from China. The acceleration 
that many of those same developing and commodity-exporting economies experienced has dramatically 
decreased since the end of 2015.

Supply of imports into China is mostly dominated by Asian countries, with a combined share of 
around 30% of total imports. Purchases from Europe and the U.S. account for 12% and 8%, respectively. 
As a major global buyer of commodities, imports from Africa, Australia, the Middle East and South 
America have increased strongly in the last decade to represent a combined share of around 50%.

In parallel with skyrocketing exports, growth in imports of real goods and services soared in 
the 2002-2008 period, recording an annual average expansion of 24.4%. Imports experienced a 
contraction in 2009 due to the global crisis, but recovered quickly in 2010 and 2011. In the 
2012-2013 period, imports recorded a modest increase of 7.2%.

As the construction boom fades in China, fewer natural resources are demanded. This has pulled 
down global prices for base metals, energy products, as well as other resources. Imports contracted 
a sharp 14.3% in 2015 as the Chinese economy adjusted to its new growth dynamics.

China’s Economic Policy

Economic growth soared in the last few decades mainly due to the country’s increasing integration 
into the global economy and the government’s bold support for economic activity. However, the 
successful economic model that lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and fueled the country’s 
astonishing economic and social development has also brought many challenges. Severe economic 
imbalances, mounting environmental issues, rising economic inequality and an aging population are 
the key questions that the new administration lead by President Xi Jinping will have to tackle in 
the near future in order to ensure the country’s sustainability.

China’s Fiscal Policy

Before 1978, China had a highly centralized fiscal system, which mainly reflected the country’s 
planned economic system. The central government collected all revenues and allocated all the 
spending of the administration and public institutions. In parallel with the reforms implemented 
in the country for Deng Xiaoping, the government started to decentralize the fiscal system.

In 1994, the government launched a bold fiscal reform in order to struggle against a rapid decline 
in the tax/GDP ratio, which dampened the government’s ability to conduct macroeconomic and 
redistribution policies. The flagship of the reform was a new taxation system and the adoption 
of a tax-sharing scheme, where the most lucrative sources of tax revenues, such as the Value-Added 
Tax and the Enterprise Income Tax, were administered by the central government.

The result of this reform was a steady increase in revenues, which jumped from 10.8% of GDP in 
1994 to 22.7% of GDP in 2013. While expenditures followed suit and increased at a double-digit 
rate in the same period, the fiscal deficit was kept in check. In the 1994-2013 period, the 
government’s fiscal deficit averaged 1.4% of GDP.

The new system, however, left local governments with fewer sources of revenue. As a result they 
had to rely on land sales and indirect borrowing (mostly so-called “shadow banking”) to finance 
their activity. In addition, local governments put in place off-budget local government financing 
vehicles to raise funds and finance investment projects.

Although debt is still at manageable levels, an increase in the reliance on shadow banking and the 
rapid pace of debt accumulation is worrisome. In an effort to increase revenue sources for local 
governments, in August 2014, the National People’s Congress passed amendments to the budget law, 
allowing provincial government to issue bonds directly and increase transparency. This move paves 
the way for local governments to raise debt in the bond market.

China’s government debt is almost entirely denominated in local currency and owned by domestic 
institutions. In addition, the government has cash savings equivalent to 6% of GDP in the People’s 
Bank of China. This situation shields the economy against government debt crises. In 2015, public 
debt amounted to 15.6% of GDP.

China’s Monetary Policy

Under the guidance of the State Council, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) formulates and implements 
monetary policy, prevents and resolves financial risks, and safeguards financial stability. The PBOC’s 
main objectives are: ensuring domestic price stability, managing the exchange rate and promoting 
economic growth. At the beginning of each year, the State Council establishes guiding targets for GDP, 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI), money supply (M2) and credit growth. The PBOC’s policy rate is the 
one-year lending rate. The Central Bank recently vowed to maintain a “prudent” monetary policy while 
conducting policy fine-tuning at an appropriate time during the National People’s Congress (NPC) in 
March of 2016.

The Central Bank manages money supply through Open Market Operations (OMO), which are conducted with 
both domestic and foreign currencies and comprise repo and reverse repo, government securities and 
PBOC bills. The Bank also uses the reserve requirement ratio to influence lending and liquidity. 
Other instruments that the Central Bank uses to manage and adjust liquidity in the banking system 
are short-term loans, short-term liquidity and standing lending facility operations.

The agenda of China’s top authorities include bold reforms on interest rate and monetary policy 
management in order to adopt a more market-driven approach.

China’s Exchange Rate Policy

The IMF labels China’s exchange rate regime as a crawl-like arrangement. The speed and direction of 
the crawling peg is decided by Chinese authorities according to domestic and international economic 
developments. The PBOC classifies its regime as a managed floating exchange rate regime based on 
market supply and demand with reference to an undisclosed basket of currencies. The U.S. dollar is 
likely to represent a large stake of the basket. The yuan fluctuates in an intraday trading band 
around an official midpoint rate. On 15 March 2014, the PBOC widened the trading band from +/-1 to 
+/-2.

From 1995 to 2005, China kept its currency fixed versus the U.S. dollar at around 8.28 CNY per USD. 
This was the case until 2005, when it switched to a managed float of the currency to facilitate a 
controlled appreciation of the CNY. However, in the wake of the global financial crisis, China pegged 
its currency to the USD at 6.82 CNY per USD from June 2008 to June 2010.Since then, the PBOC has made 
a number of revaluations to the currency in order to bring it closer to it market value.

While the Chinese yuan is freely convertible under the current account, it remains strictly regulated 
in the capital account. Chinese authorities expressed their willingness to allow the yuan to be fully 
convertible in the near future.

Chinese authorities are gradually enhancing the use of the currency in other parts of the world in 
order to promote the yuan as a global reserve currency. Although the process is far from being 
completed, China has already established trade settlements with selected countries and launched a 
series of currency swap agreements with more than 20 central banks. In addition, China is rapidly 
expanding the yuan’s offshore market. The opening up of the country’s capital market will be a crucial 
step in the yuan’s journey to becoming a major reserve currency.
