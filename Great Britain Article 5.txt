1.Main points
Patterns of crime in the year ending September 2021 have been significantly affected by the coronavirus 
(COVID-19) pandemic and government restrictions on social contact. There was significant variation in 
the level of restrictions in place across this time period and, at times, further variation across 
regions. This creates a challenge in isolating the level of impact that restrictions may have had on 
patterns of crime.

The number of incidents decreased for many types of crime during periods of national lockdowns. However, 
police recorded crime data show indications that over the last six months, certain offence types are 
returning to or exceeding the levels seen before the pandemic. This pattern has not yet emerged in the 
Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW)1 data, possibly reflecting the time lag 
in recording incidents via the survey.

Fraud and computer misuse offences do not follow the lockdown-related pattern of reduced victimisation, 
and increases in these offences more than offset the reductions seen for other types of crime.

Overall, Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimates provide the best indicator of long-term 
trends in crime. Estimates from the TCSEW for the year ending September 2021 compared with the 
pre-coronavirus year ending September 20192 show:

a 14% increase in total crime, driven by a 47% increase in fraud and computer misuse
crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 14%, largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft 
offences
The TCSEW shows little change in total number of incidents of violence but a 27% decrease in the number 
of victims of violent crime. This is largely driven by falls in violence where the offender was a stranger3, 
where the number of victims has dropped by 50%, in part reflecting the closure of the night-time economy 
for several months of the year.

Police recorded crime data give more insight into lower-volume but higher-harm crimes that the survey 
does not cover or does not capture well. Compared with the year ending September 2020 they show:

little change in the number of homicides, with 666 offences recorded (this is a 5% increase excluding 
the Grays lorry incident)
a 9% decrease in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms
a 10% decrease in offences involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime)
Sexual offences recorded by the police were at the highest level recorded within a 12-month period 
(170,973 offences) in the year ending September 2021, a 12% increase from the same period in 2020. Rape 
accounted for 37% of these offences and the year ending September 2021 saw the highest recorded annual 
number of rape offences to date (63,136 offences).

Within these annual figures, the number of recorded sexual and rape offences were lower during periods 
of lockdown but there have been substantial increases since April 2021. However, caution is needed when 
interpreting the level of police recorded sexual offences. Changes in the figures may reflect a number of 
factors including the impact of high-profile cases and campaigns on victims’ willingness to report incidents.

Notes for: Main points
The Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) began data collection on 20 May 2020 to 
capture trends in crime while normal face-to-face interviewing was suspended.

The year ending September 2019 face-to-face Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) data are the latest 
that are based on a sample that is independent of the year ending September 2021 Telephone-operated Crime 
Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) and allow for comparison over time.

This is not indicative of levels of domestic abuse during the pandemic. Information on domestic abuse can 
be found in Section 7.

2.Overall estimates of crime
!
Crime estimates for the year ending September 2021 best reflect the current extent of crime experienced by 
the population resident in households (Appendix Table A2). However, new telephone-based survey (TCSEW) 
estimates are not directly comparable with previous survey (CSEW) estimates because of changes to the sample 

and questionnaire (see Section 14). Percentage changes and long-term trends are presented using figures adjusted 
for these differences (Appendix Table A3).

The Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) began data collection on 20 May 2020 to 
capture trends in crime while normal face-to-face interviewing was suspended following restrictions on social 
contact during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

According to TCSEW estimates, adults aged 18 years and over experienced 12.9 million offences in the year ending 
September 2021 (Appendix Table A2) including fraud and computer misuse. There were decreases across a range of 
individual crime types, particularly amongst theft offences. However, these were more than offset by rises in fraud 
and computer misuse offences (see Section 9), resulting in a 14% increase in overall levels of crime since the year 
ending September 2019.

Total crime excluding fraud and computer misuse decreased by 14% compared with the year ending September 2019. 
This was largely driven by an 18% decrease in theft offences (Appendix Table A3). These decreases were related to 
the coronavirus pandemic and government instructions to limit social contact.

For the crime types and population it covers, the face-to-face Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a better 
indicator of long-term trends than police recorded crime. It is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the 
police or police recording practices. Our comparability report has shown that TCSEW estimates can be directly compared 
with these long-term CSEW estimates when certain adjustments are applied (Appendix Table A3).

Further information on these changes is available in the Measuring the data section.

Since the mid-1990s, there have been long-term falls in overall CSEW crime estimates (Figure 1). Long-term trends 
vary by crime types. For all headline figures, including a data time series, see Appendix tables.

Notes:
Data from the TCSEW are published as Experimental Statistics.
Data on this chart refer to different time periods: 1981 to 1999 refer to crimes experienced in the calendar year; 
and from year ending March 2002 onwards the estimates relate to crimes experienced in the 12 months before interview, 
based on interviews carried out in that financial year.
TCSEW data presented here for 2021 are not comparable with CSEW estimates. CSEW data relate to adults aged 16 years 
and over or to households. TCSEW data relate to adults aged 18 years and over or to households. See Appendix Table A3 
for comparable data.
New questions on fraud and computer misuse were incorporated into the CSEW from October 2015. The questions were asked 
of half the survey sample from October 2015 until September 2017 and have been asked of a full sample from October 2017.

Likelihood of victimisation
The latest estimates show that 8 in 10 adults did not experience any of the crimes covered by the TCSEW in the year 
ending September 2021 (Figure 2).

Data from the TCSEW are published as Experimental Statistics.
Percentages for violence, robbery, theft from the person, fraud and computer misuse are quoted for adults. Percentages 
for domestic burglary and criminal damage are quoted for households. Percentage for vehicle-related theft and bicycle 
theft are quoted for vehicle- or bicycle-owning households.
For all TCSEW crime, including fraud and computer misuse, this is the estimated percentage of adults who have been a 
victim of at least one personal crime or have been resident in a household that was a victim of at least one household crime.

The TCSEW also showed that the likelihood of being a victim of crime varied by demographic characteristics. For more 
information, see the annual trend and demographic tables.

Trends in police recorded crime
!
Improvements to recording processes and practices by the police, expansions of the recorded crime collection to include 
new offences, variations in police activity, more victims reporting crime, and genuine increases in some types of crime, 
have each made substantial contributions to rises in recorded crime in recent years. This effect has been more pronounced 
for some crime types. For some types of offence these figures do not provide reliable trends in crime.

The police recorded 5.8 million crimes in England and Wales in the year ending September 2021; this is a 2% increase compared 
with the previous year. However, the number of offences fell 1% (to 4.9 million) when excluding fraud and computer misuse.

Police recorded crime has fluctuated across the year ending September 2021 and hides a lot of variation by crime type. 
Most of the fluctuations can be attributed to the introduction and subsequent easing of national lockdown restrictions 
throughout the year alongside more normal seasonal variations for some crime types.

Total police recorded crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) in the year ending September 2021 saw the lowest levels 
of crime during the first part of the year compared with the two years prior. This coincides with the reintroduction of 
tighter restrictions on social contact and national lockdowns put in place. The number of offences recorded in a single 
month was lowest in February 2021 (333,740 offences), but began to rise from March 2021 onwards as national restrictions 
began to ease (Figure 3).

Compared with the previous year, recorded crime between July and September 2021 was 6% higher than the same period in 2020, 
reflecting a similar rise seen in the previous quarter (April to June 2021). This increase was likely a reflection of the 
national restrictions in place during these periods. Levels of crime between July and September 2021 have now returned to 
similar levels seen in July to September 2019.

Total police recorded crime including fraud and computer misuse followed a similar but less pronounced 
pattern to crime 
that excludes these offences. Offences recorded by Action Fraud or referred to the National Fraud 
Intelligence Bureau 
(NFIB) were 24% higher in the year ending September 2021 compared with the year ending September 2020.

3.Homicide
The police recorded 666 homicide offences in the year ending September 2021, a 1% decrease the previous year 
(671 offences). The year ending September 2020 included the Grays lorry incident, which involved the death of 
39 people. Excluding this incident from the previous year’s homicide count, the number of homicides showed a 
5% increase (from 632 to 666 offences) in the year ending September 2021.

Notes:
The dates shown for the London terrorist attacks in 2005 and 2017, and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, 
correspond to when the events occurred, rather than when the homicides were recorded by the police.
Data on homicide offences given in these police recorded crime data will differ from data from the Home Office 
Homicide Index.

The rate of homicide in England and Wales remained at 11 per 1 million people in the year ending September 
2021.

The number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved increased from 256 to 276 offences in 
the year ending September 2021. Of all recorded homicides in the latest year, the method of killing by knife 
or sharp instrument was 42% of offences, an increase from 39% in the previous year.

4.Knife or sharp instrument offences
Police recorded crime provides a better measure than the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) of 
higher-harm but less common types of violence, such as those involving a knife or sharp instrument (knife-enabled crime).

!
Figures referenced in this section are not directly comparable with those previously published because of 
a change in knife or sharp instrument data collection practices.

There was a 10% decrease in knife-enabled crime recorded by the police in the year ending September 2021 
(46,239 offences) compared with the previous year. This was driven by a 20% decrease in robbery offences 
to 16,601.

The largest decreases in total knife-enabled crime were seen in October to December 2020 and January to 
March 2021 with offences down by 16% and 22% compared with respective periods in the previous year. Both 
these periods coincided with national lockdowns and the highest levels of restrictions on social contact. 
Police recorded data in the last six months show an increase in knife-enabled crime following the ease of 
lockdown restrictions, however, levels are still below those seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Notes:
Greater Manchester Police reviewed their recording of offences involving knives or sharp instruments in December 
2017 which revealed that they were under-counting these offences. Previous data were not revised at the time 
and therefore data from Greater Manchester Police are excluded to allow for comparison over time.
An adjustment has been made to data prior to the year ending March 2020 for police forces who are now using the 
NDQIS tool and the total for England and Wales. For more information on the adjustment to the time series and 
the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note ‘Police recorded offences involving 
knives or sharp instruments: methodology changes’.
Other selected offences include rape, attempted murder, homicide, and sexual assault.
Download this chartFigure 5: Knife-enabled crime decreased in the latest year driven by a decrease in robbery 
offences
Image .csv .xls
Knife or sharp instrument offences are concentrated in urban areas1. For the three police force areas (PFAs) 
with the highest volume of knife-enabled crime we have seen:

a 17% decrease in the Metropolitan Police PFA2
an 8% decrease in the West Midlands PFA
a 2% increase in Greater Manchester PFA
Police recorded “possession of article with a blade or point”3 offences increased by 5% to 22,542 in the year 
ending September 2021. This could have been influenced by increases in targeted police action.

The Home Office and police forces have continued to roll out a new methodology for identifying recorded offences 
involving knives or sharp instruments (knife-enabled crime). Thirty-three forces have now switched to the National 
Data Quality Improvement Service (NDQIS) data collection methodology4. The aim is to roll out the new methodology 
to all forces in England and Wales over the next year. Estimates in this release include a combination of both new 
and old data collection methods.

For more information, including the differences in data collection methods, please see the methodology note Police 
recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments, methodology changes and blog.

Other sources of data
The latest available provisional admissions data for NHS hospitals in England and Wales reported a 12% decrease 
in admissions for assault by a sharp object in the year ending September 2021 (to 4,005 admissions).

For data relating to knife-enabled crime see Other related tables, for geographic breakdowns see Police force area 
data tables and for sharp instrument homicides see Appendix tables: homicide in England and Wales. Data related to 
stop and searches can be found in the Home Office publication Police powers and procedures.

Notes for: Knife or sharp instrument offences
Data cannot be compared across all police forces because of changes in data collection methods. Thirty-three police 
forces have now switched to the NDQIS data collection method. Remaining police forces are still submitting knife or 
sharp instrument offences data via a special collection. For more information, please see the methodology note Police 
recorded offences involving knives or sharp instruments: methodology changes.

Includes the Metropolitan and City of London Police Force Areas.

Offences of “possession of an article with a blade or point” are covered separately by a specific recorded crime 
category, which is the specific crime of possessing an article with a blade or point illegally.

The 33 forces that have switched to the NDQIS data collection method are: Avon and Somerset, Cambridgeshire, 
Cheshire, City of London, Cleveland, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Devon and Cornwall, Durham, Dyfed-Powys, Essex, Greater 
Manchester, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Humberside, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, 
Metropolitan Police, Norfolk, North Wales, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, South Wales, South Yorkshire, Suffolk, 
Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Remaining police forces are still submitting knife 
and sharp instrument offences data via a special collection.

5.Offences involving firearms
Police recorded offences involving firearms decreased by 9% to 5,653 offences in the year ending September 2021 
compared with 6,244 offences in the previous year. This decrease may be related to national lockdown restrictions 
that occurred throughout the year. Offences involving firearms have not returned to levels seen before the 
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and are at their lowest level since the year ending March 2016.

Notes:
More explicit guidelines for the classification of weapons introduced on 1 April 2004 may have increased the recording 
of firearm offences, particularly those committed by imitation weapons.
Excludes offences involving the use of conventional air weapons, such as air rifles and offences recorded by British 
Transport Police. Includes crimes recorded by police where a firearm has been fired, used as a blunt instrument against 
a person or used as a threat.
Most police forces have made data quality and recording improvements which means data from earlier years are not directly 
comparable with recent years. Some forces have also revised data, which means data may not match earlier publications.
Imitation firearms include replica weapons, as well as low-powered weapons which fire small plastic pellets, such as 
BB guns and soft air weapons.

6.Violence
The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the best picture of the overall trend in violent crime.

Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.8 million 
violent offences in the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). Using a comparable dataset adjusted for 
changes in the sample and questionnaire between the CSEW and TCSEW (see Appendix Table A3), there was no significant 
change in total violent incidents compared with the year ending September 2019.

Data from the TCSEW are published as Experimental Statistics.
Data on this chart refer to different time periods: 1981 to 1999 refer to crimes experienced in the calendar year; and 
from year ending March 2002 onwards the estimates relate to crimes experienced in the 12 months before interview, based 
on interviews carried out in that financial year.
TCSEW data presented here for 2021 are not comparable with CSEW estimates. CSEW data relate to adults aged 16 years 
and over, or to households. TCSEW data relate to adults aged 18 years and over, or to households. See Appendix Table 
A3 for comparable data.
Download this chartFigure 7: The CSEW shows long-term reductions in violent crime
Image .csv .xls
Although the TCSEW indicated no change in the total number of violence incidents, there was a 27% decrease in the 
number of victims compared with the year ending September 2019. (Appendix Table A3). This was largely driven by 
falls in the prevalence of violence where the offender was a stranger. This likely reflects a decrease in violence 
taking place in public spaces during national lockdown restrictions. However, there has been a large but non-significant 
increase in acquaintance violence1. These estimates of violence are not indicative of levels of domestic abuse during 
the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic since the TCSEW was not able to produce such estimates.

Police recorded crime data showed a 3% decrease in violence with injury, to 499,880 offences, but a 3% increase in 
violence without injury (736,185 offences) in the year ending September 2021.

Overall, total police recorded violence was 8% higher than the previous year. Much of this increase was driven by 
a rise in the number of stalking and harassment offences, which increased 21% (excluding controlling and 
coercive behaviour)2 in the year ending September 2021. This may be caused by improvements made by police forces 
in identifying and recording stalking and harassment offences together with an increased confidence in victims 
coming forward to report these offences.

For more detailed figures relating to violent crime, including a data time series, see Appendix tables.

Notes for: Violence
Acquaintance violence includes victims who knew one or more offenders, at least by sight; it does not include 
domestic violence (between partners, ex-partners or family members).

From April 2020, controlling and coercive behaviour was categorised under the stalking and harassment offence 
category. To allow for comparison with the previous year, controlling and coercive behaviour has been removed 
from overall stalking and harassment figures.

Back to table of contents
7.Domestic abuse and sexual offences
!
Domestic abuse-related crimes and sexual offences recorded by the police do not provide a reliable measure of 
trends in these types of crime. Improvements in police recording practices and increased reporting by victims 
have contributed to increases in recent years. The figures do, however, provide a good measure of the crime-related 
demand on the police.

The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides a more reliable measure of long-term trends in domestic abuse, 
sexual assault, stalking and harassment. Questions related to these offences had to be suspended with the move to 
telephone interviewing from May 2020.

Domestic abuse
Police recorded crime data, in isolation, do not provide a measure of prevalence to understand the true extent of 
domestic abuse. Therefore, figures presented in this release should be interpreted with caution.

The police recorded 872,911 offences (excluding fraud) flagged as domestic abuse-related in the year ending 
September 2021. This represents a 5% increase from 835,319 offences in the same period in the previous year. 
This included 694,385 violence against the person offences flagged as domestic abuse-related, a 5% increase 
compared with the year ending September 2020.

Some of this increase may reflect improvements seen in reporting over the last few years. Following the 
suspension of the CSEW, we were unable to draw upon analysis from the crime survey as we cannot collect survey 
data on domestic abuse. This is because of concerns around confidentiality and respondent safeguarding, which 
limit the types of questions asked via the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales.

Given this, we cannot conclude whether there has been an increase in the number of victims of domestic abuse. 
However, data from victim services suggest that experiences of domestic abuse may have intensified during periods 
of national lockdown and that victims faced difficulties in safely seeking support under these conditions.

Further information and data related to domestic abuse can be found in Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview: 
November 2021.

Sexual offences
Police recorded data need to be treated with caution, particularly in the absence of survey data. High levels of 
non-reporting combined with changes in reporting trends can have a significant impact on sexual offences recorded 
by the police. Prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of police recorded sexual offences was 
well below the number of victims estimated by the crime survey, with fewer than one in six victims of rape or 
assault by penetration reporting the crime to the police.

The latest figures may reflect a number of factors, including the impact of high-profile incidents, media coverage 
and campaigns on people’s willingness to report incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number 
of victims. The overall trend is also currently difficult to disentangle from the impact of lockdowns. Offences 
recorded by the police dropped noticeably during the spring 2020 lockdown before rebounding to previous levels 
in the July to September 2020 quarter. The winter 2020 to 2021 lockdowns saw a smaller reduction in the number 
of sexual offences recorded by the police but a greater level of increase in these offences in the subsequent 
quarters.

The number of sexual offences recorded by the police showed a 12% increase in the year ending September 2021 
(170,973 offences) compared with the same period in the previous year. This is the highest number of sexual 
offences recorded within a 12-month period, driven by noticeable increases since April 2021. The period July 
to September 2021 saw the second-highest recorded quarterly figure (47,643 offences), following the highest 
recorded figures in April to June 2021 (48,131 offences) (see Figure 8).

Rape accounted for 37% of all sexual offences recorded by the police. The number of rape offences in the year 
ending September 2021 was the highest recorded annual figure to date (63,136 offences). This was driven by a 
large increase across the last six months of the year, with 17,189 offences recorded in April to June 2021, 
followed by a further increase to 17,419 offences in July to September 2021. This is the highest number of 
rape offences recorded within a quarter in England and Wales.

8.Theft offences
The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is the most reliable indicator for long-term trends in 
the more common types of crime experienced by the general population, such as theft. However, police 
recorded crime data can give reliable indications of trends in some offences involving theft (for example, 
domestic burglary) and may provide a better measure of short-term trends.

There were 3 million incidents of theft estimated by the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and 
Wales (TCSEW) for the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). This was an 18% decrease compared 
with the year ending September 2019 (Appendix Table A3). This large fall was seen across most sub-categories, 
with the largest fall of 53% seen in the “theft from the person” offence, followed by a 26% decrease in 
vehicle-related offences and a 23% decrease in bicycle theft offences.

A similar pattern was seen in police recorded theft offences, which decreased by 14% in the year ending 
September 2021 compared with the same period in the previous year, from 1.6 million to 1.4 million offences. 
This was driven by decreases in offences such as: burglary (21%), theft from the person (20%), vehicle 
offences (14%) and shoplifting (13%). However, there was a 9% increase in metal theft offences (to 19,044) 
recorded by the police in England and Wales for the year ending March 2021 following improved recording of 
catalytic converter theft by the Metropolitan Police.

Police recorded robbery offences decreased by 18% in the year ending September 2021 compared with the same 
period in the previous year, from 75,159 to 61,486 offences.

All these falls were likely to be driven by national lockdown restrictions, with non-essential shops and 
the night-time economy being closed and people spending more time in their homes. However, police recorded 
crime data indicate theft offences such as theft of a motor vehicle and bicycle theft are starting to return 
to levels seen before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (see Other related tables).

For the latest headline figures relating to theft and for more detailed figures, including data time series, 
see Appendix tables and our latest Property crime tables.

Data from the TCSEW are published as Experimental Statistics.
Data on this chart refer to different time periods: 1981 to 1999 refer to crimes experienced in the calendar year; 
and from year ending March 2002 onwards the estimates relate to crimes experienced in the 12 months before 
interview, based on interviews carried out in that financial year.
TCSEW data presented here for 2021 are not comparable with CSEW estimates. CSEW data relate to adults aged 
16 years and over or to households. TCSEW data relate to adults aged 18 years and over or to households.

9.Fraud
Fraud estimates do not follow the trend of falling victimisation seen in other crime types over the lockdown 
periods. Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there 
were 5.1 million fraud offences in the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). This is a 36% increase 
compared with the year ending September 2019 (Appendix Table A3).

This included large increases in “advance fee fraud”, “consumer and retail fraud” and “other fraud” and may 
indicate fraudsters taking advantage of behaviour changes related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, such 
as increased online shopping and increased savings. For example, advance fee fraud offences included scams where 
victims transferred funds to fraudsters for postal deliveries; other fraud included investment opportunity scams. 
A minority (26%) of these offences resulted in loss of money or property, with no or only partial reimbursement.

Fraud offences reported to the police are recorded and collected by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) 
from Action Fraud and two industry bodies, Cifas and UK Finance. Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and 
cybercrime reporting centre) reported a 27% rise in fraud offences (to 413,417 offences) compared with the year 
ending September 2020. The data showed a 42% increase in “financial investment fraud” offences in the last year 
(from 15,702 to 22,372 offences) and an 18% rise in “advance fee payments” (from 43,555 to 51,407 offences).

NFIB data showed referrals from Cifas (who report instances of fraud where their member organisations have been 
victims) increased 5% (to 319,512 offences) compared with the year ending September 2020 while UK Finance reported 
a 49% increase (to 155,757 offences).

Many cases recorded separately by UK Finance (via a fraud reporting database called CAMIS) are not reported to 
the NFIB because they hold insufficient information to be of value from an intelligence perspective. UK Finance 
reported a 5% increase in fraud incidents (to 3.2 million incidents) in CAMIS. There was a 53% increase in remote 
banking fraud (to 94,757 incidents), which reflects the greater number of people now regularly using internet, 
telephone and mobile banking, and the attempts by fraudsters to take advantage of this.

see Appendix tables, Other related tables and Police force area tables.

10.Computer misuse
Estimates from the Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that there were 1.9 million 
computer misuse offences in the year ending September 2021 (Appendix Table A2). This was an 89% increase compared with 
the year ending September 2019, largely driven by a 161% increase in “Unauthorised access to personal information 
(including hacking)” offences (Appendix Table A3). This included victims’ details being compromised via large-scale 
data breaches, and victims’ email or social media accounts being compromised. Our most recent Nature of fraud and 
computer misuse tables reported that 54% of victims were not impacted at all by such incidents.

The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) also reported a 17% increase in “Hacking – personal” offences referred 
by Action Fraud (from 4,498 to 5,258 offences). See Appendix Table A5.

The TCSEW provides a better indication of the volume of computer misuse offences experienced by the adult population 
as it captures incidents that go unreported to the police. This can be seen by the large difference in the volume of 
computer misuse offences between the two sources, which also cannot be compared because of differences in coverage.

For the latest headline figures relating to computer misuse and for more detailed figures see Appendix tables and Other 
related tables. Additionally, the Nature of crime: fraud and computer misuse tables hold more in-depth information about 
these offences from year ending March 2021 data.

11.Anti-social behaviour
The Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) showed that 26% of adults personally witnessed or 
experienced anti-social behaviour in their area in the last 12 months.

Estimates from the TCSEW showed that 47% of adults noticed individuals breaching virus restrictions in their local area 
since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began. Of these, 7% reported the breach to the police.

TCSEW includes a measure of harassment that covers adults experiencing being insulted, called names, threatened or 
shouted at in public spaces. These estimates showed that 7% of adults experienced these types of harassment in the year 
ending September 2021. Where a specific perceived reason for the harassment was given, the most common was because of the 
coronavirus pandemic (27%). This included experiences related to social distancing and lockdown restrictions.

The most common non-coronavirus-related perceived reason for these experiences was their education, income level or job 
(10%), followed by race or ethnicity (6%).

The police recorded 1.7 million incidents of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in the year ending September 2021, a 9% decrease 
compared with the year ending September 2020. Anti-social behaviour was particularly high early on in the year, with the 
highest number of incidents recorded in January to March 2021 (448,776 offences), which is likely to reflect the reporting 
of breaches to public health restrictions. This was offset by continued decreases in April to June 2021 (419,128 offences) 
and July to September 2021 (356,833 offences).
